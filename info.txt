To get this working you need the following software

Rhino5 for PC (educational lab license available for FabLabs and students)
Grasshopper (free plugin for Rhino)
Firefly (free plugin for Grasshopper, lets us read the state of the Ardunio)
Flounder (free plugin for Grasshoper, lets control and lock the viewport in Rhino from Grasshopper)

You also need an Ardunino microcontroller to read the output pin of the ShopBot control board.
We bought our resin from Spot-A-Materials, Low visocity - High reactivity for versatile setups
We used a Acer H5360 projector, it successor H6510BD is reccomended.
